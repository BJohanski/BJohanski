- Hi there, I'm Ben Johanski.
- After graduating from Kalamazoo College with a major in business and a minor in music (composition and audio engineering),
I began my professional career in the project management space, specifically for software development. After about two and a half years focusing on my role in the PMO,
I realized that I felt much more at home when discussing, investigating, and troubleshooting data integrity problems alongside our solution and business analysts.
Through this realization, I took the initiative to begin learning Python, SQL, and R via Codecademy. I just recently finalized my data sciences certification, and plan to pursue a career in the field.
- I'd love to collaborate with anyone who is newer to data analytics to review one-another's code, so please feel free to reach out! Additionally, if you happen to review my public projects and have feedback, I'd appreciate it greatly.

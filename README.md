- Hi there, I'm Ben Johanski.
- After graduating from Kalamazoo College with a major in business and a minor in music (composition and audio engineering),
I began my professional career in the project management space, specifically for software development. After about two and a half years focusing mainly on project management,
I realized that I felt much more at home when discussing, investigating, and troubleshooting problems with data integrity alongside our solution and business analysts.
Through this realization, I took the initiative to begin learning Python, SQL, and R via Codecademy.
I now have my certification in data analytics, and plan to continuously grow my skillset through a position in the field.
- I'd love to collaborate with anyone who is newer to analytics who may want to trade and review code. Feel free to reach out!
